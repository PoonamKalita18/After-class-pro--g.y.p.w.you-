            peacock, any of three species of resplendent birds of the pheasant family, Phasianidae (order Galliformes). Strictly,
            the male is a peacock, and the female is a peahen; both are peafowl. The two most-recognizable species of peafowl are
            the blue, or Indian, peacock (Pavo cristatus), of India and Sri Lanka, and the green, or Javanese, peacock (P. muticus),
            found from Myanmar (Burma) to Java. The Congo peacock (Afropavo congensis), which inhabits the forested interior of the
            Democratic Republic of the Congo, was discovered in 1936 after a search that began in 1913 with the finding of a single
            feather.

            <h1>Natural History of Peacock</h1>
         <p>
            In blue and green peacocks, the male has a 90–130-cm (35–50-inch) body and 150-cm (60-inch) train of tail feathers that
            are coloured a brilliant metallic green. This train is mainly formed of the bird’s upper tail coverts, which are
            enormously elongated. Each feather is tipped with an iridescent eyespot that is ringed with blue and bronze. In
            courtship displays, the cock elevates his tail, which lies under the train, thus elevating the train and bringing it
            forward. At the climax of this display, the tail feathers are vibrated, giving the feathers of the train a shimmering
            appearance and making a rustling sound.
